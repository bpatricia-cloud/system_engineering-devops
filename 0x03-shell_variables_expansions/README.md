This project explores environment variables, shell initialization files, and expansions in Linux. Learners will gain practical experience in creating and managing environment and local variables, configuring initialization files for custom settings, and using expansions to perform dynamic operations within the shell. By completing these tasks, learners will understand how to customize the shell environment and enhance their scripts with variables and expansions.
